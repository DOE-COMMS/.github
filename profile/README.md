# Center for Mesoscale Computational Materials Science

This project is supported as part of the [Computational Materials Sciences Program](https://www.greencarcongress.com/2019/06/20190613-doe.html) funded by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, under Award Number DE-SC0020145 (DOE Program Manager: Matthias Graf, Matthias.Graf@science.doe.gov)

## Q-POP

A primary objective of this project is to create a software package (Q-POP, Quantum Phase-field Open-source Package) that facilitates computationally efficient phase-field modeling of quantum materials. Q-POP empowers researchers to investigate quantum materials and phase transitions—including superconductivity, metal-insulator transitions, and strongly-correlated materials—through the application of the phase-field method.

We are integrating existing tools and codes that we have developed into Q-POP, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience for all users.

## Existing individual tools

1. Q-POP-Thermo
2. BoltzTraP2Y: Atomic to Mesoscale Bridging
3. Q-POP-Diffraction: A Software Module to Computer Diffration Patterns of Phase-field Simulated Microstructures
4. PyVecAnalysis: A Software Module for Automated Identification of Topological Structures
5. SHAARP: Analytical and Numerical Modeling of Optical Second Harmonic Generation in Anisotropic Crystals
