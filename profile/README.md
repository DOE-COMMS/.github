# Center for Mesoscale Computational Materials Science

This project is supported as part of the [Computational Materials Sciences Program](https://www.greencarcongress.com/2019/06/20190613-doe.html) funded by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, under Award Number DE-SC0020145 (DOE Program Manager: Matthias Graf, Matthias.Graf@science.doe.gov)

## Q-POP

A primary objective of this project is to create a software package (Q-POP, Quantum Phase-field Open-source Package) that facilitates computationally efficient phase-field modeling of quantum materials. Q-POP empowers researchers to investigate quantum materials and phase transitions—including superconductivity, metal-insulator transitions, and strongly-correlated materials—through the application of the phase-field method.

We are integrating existing tools and codes that we have developed into Q-POP, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience for all users.

## Existing individual tools

1. Q-POP-HTP: high-throughput simulation jobs generator
1. Q-POP-Thermo: to calculate the equilibrium temperature-strain phase
2. Q-POP-BoltzTraP2Y: a modern implementation of the smoothed Fourier interpolation algorithm for electronic bands
3. Q-POP-Diffraction: to compute diffration patterns of phase-field simulated microstructures
4. Q-POP-PyVecAnalysis: to automate identification of topological structures
5. Q-POP-#SHAARP: analytical and numerical modeling of optical second harmonic generation in anisotropic crystals
